## Understanding the Recursive Case

### What is Recursion?

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It's an effective method to solve problems that can be broken down into simpler, repetitive tasks.

### Components of Recursion

1. **Base Case:**
   - The base case is the condition under which the recursion stops. It prevents the function from calling itself indefinitely. This is typically the simplest instance of the problem, which can be solved directly.

2. **Recursive Case:**
   - The recursive case is where the function calls itself with a modified parameter, moving towards the base case. This step breaks the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.

### Example Breakdown

Let's consider an example: Calculating the factorial of a number `n`.

The factorial of `n` (denoted as `n!`) is defined as:

- `n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1`

Using recursion, we can define it as:

1. **Base Case:**
   - When `n` is 0, the factorial of 0 is 1. (`0! = 1`)
   - ```python
     if n == 0:
         return 1
     ```

2. **Recursive Case:**
   - For any other `n`, the factorial of `n` is `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n-1`.
   - ```python
     else:
         return n * factorial(n - 1)
     ```

Hereâ€™s the complete recursive function:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1  # Base case
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)  # Recursive case
